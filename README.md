### [Blazing Star - Replace Bonus Sound [mame]](https://github.com/KMHSTG/BlazingStar-ReplaceBonusSound)
Changes the sound (voice) that plays when you pick up a bonus item, replacing it with the lucky panel item pickup sound effect.

### [Dangun Feveron - No Voices [mame]](https://github.com/KMHSTG/DangunFeveron-NoVoices)
Removes the voices from the game.

&nbsp; &nbsp;

### [Dodonpachi DFK / Resurrection - BL Arrange No Lock-On Sound [steam]](https://github.com/KMHSTG/DaifukkatsuBLA-NoLockOnSound)
Removes the beeping sound effect that goes off, whenever your laser/focused shot locks onto an enemy.

&nbsp; &nbsp;
-----
### [Great Mahou Daisakusen - Unlock Secret Characters [mame]](https://github.com/KMHSTG/GreatMahou-UnlockAll)
Makes the four secret characters unlocked by default.

&nbsp; &nbsp;
-----
### [Gunbird 2 - Unlock Aine [mame]](https://github.com/KMHSTG/Gunbird2-UnlockAine)
Makes Aine unlocked by default in the Gunbird 2 MAME rom. This is very useful for anyone who wants to record demos in MAME, since it allows you to record and playback demos with nvram disabled, without losing access to Aine. Demos are likely to desync without disabling nvram for this game.

&nbsp; &nbsp;

### [Ketsui - No Lock-On Sound [mame]](https://github.com/KMHSTG/Ketsui-NoLockOnSound)
Removes the beeping sound effect that goes off, whenever your laser/focused shot locks onto an enemy.

&nbsp; &nbsp;
-----
### [Ketsui - Soft Lock-On Sound [mame]](https://github.com/KMHSTG/Ketsui-SoftLockOnSound)
Lowers the volume of the beeping sound effect that goes off, whenever your laser/focused shot locks onto an enemy.

&nbsp; &nbsp;
-----
### [Sengoku Blade - Unlock Aine [mame]](https://github.com/KMHSTG/SengokuBlade-UnlockAine)
Unlocks Aine to be selectable with a single "up" input on the random select square.

&nbsp; &nbsp;
-----
### [Shikigami no Shiro - Boss Explosion Sound Fix [steam]](https://github.com/KMHSTG/Shiki1-BossExplosionSoundFix)
Fixes the messed up sound effects on the boss death explosions. The patch removes the extremely loud high-pitched noise on all of them, and lowers their volume slightly as well.

&nbsp; &nbsp;
-----
### [Shikigami no Shiro - No Background [steam]](https://github.com/KMHSTG/Shiki1-NoBackground)
Removes the UI background art entirely, so you can play the game with just the central game area on a black background.

&nbsp; &nbsp;
-----
### [Strikers 1999 / 1945-III - Unlock X-36 [mame]](https://github.com/KMHSTG/Strikers1999-UnlockX36)
Makes the X-36 unlocked by default in the Strikers 1999/1945-III MAME rom. This is very useful for anyone who wants to record demos in MAME, since it allows you to record and playback demos with nvram disabled, without losing access to the X-36. Demos are likely to desync without disabling nvram for this game. 

&nbsp; &nbsp;
-----
### [Thunder Dragon 2 - No Voices [mame]](https://github.com/KMHSTG/ThunderDragon2-NoVoices)
Removes the voices from the game.
