### [Dodonpachi DFK / Resurrection - BL Arrange No Lock-On Sound [steam]](https://github.com/KMHSTG/DaifukkatsuBLA-NoLockOnSound)
Removes the beeping sound effect that goes off, whenever your laser/focused shot locks onto an enemy.

### [Gunbird 2 - Unlock Aine [mame]](https://github.com/KMHSTG/Gunbird2-UnlockAine)
Makes Aine unlocked by default in the Gunbird 2 MAME rom. This is very useful for anyone who wants to record demos in MAME, since it allows you to record and playback demos with nvram disabled, without losing access to Aine. Demos are likely to desync without disabling nvram for this game.
